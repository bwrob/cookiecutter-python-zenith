# pytest Testing Stack (`tool-pytest`)

Zenith equips `pytest` with a modern, high-speed testing toolchain:

- **Parallel Execution**: `pytest-xdist` (`-n auto`) for multi-core speed.
- **Flakiness Detection**: `pytest-randomly` for randomized execution order.
- **Visual Progress & Fast Feedback**: `pytest-sugar` for real-time progress.
- **Snapshot Testing**: `syrupy` for clean, declarative snapshot assertions.
- **Property-Based Testing**: `hypothesis` for generative edge-case discovery.
- **Branch Coverage**: `pytest-cov` enforcing an 80%+ coverage threshold.

---

## 1. Core CLI Commands

Execute tests across the suite, single files, or in parallel.

```bash
uv run pytest                         # Run all tests with coverage
uv run pytest -n auto                 # Run tests in parallel across cores
uv run pytest path/to/test_file.py    # Run a specific test file
uv run pytest -k "test_greeting"      # Run tests matching expression
uv run pytest -m "not slow"           # Run tests excluding markers
uv run pytest --snapshot-update       # Update syrupy snapshot files (.ambr)
uv run pytest --cov --cov-report=html # Generate HTML coverage in htmlcov/
```

In Zenith, task aliases are managed via Poe:

```bash
uv run poe test                 # Run tests with coverage and doctests
uv run poe test-fast            # Run tests in parallel with xdist
uv run poe test-lowest          # Verify against lowest-direct bounds
uv run poe test-dist            # Run tests against wheel distribution
uv run poe test-snapshot-update # Update Syrupy snapshots
uv run poe coverage             # Generate HTML coverage report
```

---

## 2. Configuration Files

Pytest and coverage behavior are configured through root configuration files.

### `pytest.ini`

```ini
[pytest]
addopts =
    --verbose -ra -p no:legacypath --doctest-modules
    --import-mode=importlib --strict-config --strict-markers --snapshot-warn-unused
# Uncomment when using pytest-asyncio (0.24+) to configure default fixture loop scope:
# asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = function
collect_imported_tests = false
console_output_style   = classic
log_format             = %(asctime)s [%(levelname)8s] %(name)s: %(message)s
log_level              = DEBUG
minversion             = 9.0
strict                 = true
testpaths              = tests src
xfail_strict           = true
filterwarnings         =
    error
    default::EncodingWarning
    error::EncodingWarning:my_package.*
doctest_optionflags    =
    DONT_ACCEPT_TRUE_FOR_1
    NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    ELLIPSIS
```

> [!TIP]
> Setting `-p no:legacypath` banishes pytest's legacy `py.path.local` plugin, enforcing
> standard `pathlib.Path` across test fixtures (`tmp_path`). Setting `log_level = DEBUG`
> without `log_cli = true` captures `DEBUG` logs in memory and prints them **only when a test fails**,
> keeping passing test runs quiet and preserving LLM context window budgets.
> When using `pytest-asyncio` 0.24+, set `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = function` to
> silence event loop scoping warnings.

### `.coveragerc`

Coverage uses Python 3.12+'s low-overhead PEP 669 `sys.monitoring` engine
(`core = sysmon`), tracks subprocesses and `os._exit()` calls automatically
(`patch = subprocess, _exit`), and monitors both `src/` and `tests/` so dead
test helpers or unreachable fixture branches are immediately caught:

```ini
[run]
branch = true
core = sysmon
patch =
    subprocess
    _exit
source =
    src
    tests
omit =
    */__snapshots__/*
    */site-packages/*

[report]
fail_under = 80
show_missing = true
exclude_also =
    pragma: no cover
    def __repr__
    if TYPE_CHECKING:
    raise NotImplementedError
    return NotImplemented\b
    if __name__ == .__main__.:
    @overload
    @(typing\.)?overload
    (typing\.)?assert_never
    \.\.\.
```

## 3. Testing Paradigms in Zenith

Zenith integrates snapshot, property-based, and randomized testing patterns.

### A. Snapshot Testing with `syrupy` (or `inline-snapshot` + `dirty-equals`)

Use `syrupy` snapshot assertions for complex data structures, rendered strings,
or payloads:

```python
def test_greeting_snapshot(snapshot):
    result = get_greeting("Developer")
    assert result == snapshot
```

Snapshots are stored in `tests/__snapshots__/<test_file>.ambr`.
To update snapshots after intentional code changes:

```bash
uv run poe test-snapshot-update
```

For inline Python AST snapshots paired with declarative dynamic matchers
(`IsUUID`, `IsNow`, `IsPartialDict`), you can also combine `inline-snapshot`
and `dirty-equals`.

### B. Property-Based Testing with `hypothesis`

Use `hypothesis` to test mathematical invariants across hundreds of random
inputs:

```python
from hypothesis import given
from hypothesis import strategies as st


@given(st.text(min_size=1))
def test_greeting_always_contains_name(name: str):
    clean = name.strip()
    result = get_greeting(name)
    if clean:
        assert clean in result
    else:
        assert result == "Hello, World!"
```

### C. Randomized & Work-Stealing Execution (`pytest-randomly` & `pytest-xdist`)

`pytest-randomly` runs tests in a different order on every invocation. If a test
fails only when run after another test, they share state (e.g. global variables,
un-reset caches, or dirty file systems).

To reproduce a specific randomized run:

```bash
uv run pytest --randomly-seed=12345
```

When running in parallel (`uv run poe test-fast`), Zenith uses
`--dist=worksteal --max-worker-restart=0` so slow property-based tests do not
bottleneck a single worker and native worker crashes fail immediately instead of
hanging.

---

## 4. Most Common Configuration Changes During Development

Register markers, tune coverage thresholds, or exclude lines with these
settings.

### A. Registering Custom Test Markers

When adding markers (e.g. `@pytest.mark.integration`), register them in
`pytest.ini` to avoid errors under `strict = true`:

```ini
[pytest]
markers =
    integration: External network or integration tests
    gpu: Hardware-dependent GPU tests
```

### B. Adjusting Coverage Thresholds

To adjust minimum branch coverage requirement in `.coveragerc`:

```ini
[report]
fail_under = 85
```

### C. Ignoring Untestable Lines from Coverage

Add exclusion regex patterns under `exclude_also` in `.coveragerc`:

```ini
exclude_also =
    pragma: no cover
    if self\.debug:
    raise AssertionError
```

### D. Strict Encoding Hygiene (`PYTHONWARNDEFAULTENCODING=1`)

Python 3.10+ introduced `EncodingWarning` (PEP 597) to identify calls to `open()`
and text streams that omit an explicit encoding argument. In Zenith, all test
tasks execute with `PYTHONWARNDEFAULTENCODING=1`. Paired with
`default::EncodingWarning` and `error::EncodingWarning:<package_name>.*` under
`filterwarnings` in `pytest.ini`, any missing `encoding="utf-8"` in first-party
code is treated as a fatal failure while preventing unpinned third-party plugin
warnings from breaking CI.

### E. Distribution Artifact Testing (`poe test-dist`)

Running `pytest` directly against `src/` can mask missing files in
`pyproject.toml` package data, broken `py.typed` markers, or distribution
compilation errors. `uv run poe test-dist` executes
`python scripts/verify_wheel.py --run-tests`, which:

1. Builds a standalone `.whl` package via `uv build --wheel`.
2. Provisions a temporary, isolated virtual environment.
3. Installs the compiled `.whl` and test dependencies.
4. Executes the full `pytest` suite against the installed distribution with
   `python -I -m pytest` (`src/` omitted from `sys.path`).

## 5. Agent Test Engineering & Anti-Slop Standards

Follow these strict engineering rules when authoring or refactoring tests:

1. **One Test File Per Unit Under Test, Not Per Change/PR**:
   Always place new tests in the canonical `tests/test_<module>.py` file for the
   unit under test. Never create grab-bag test files named after a bug ticket,
   PR, or refactor (e.g. `test_issue_123.py` or `test_new_validation.py`), which
   fragment module coverage. Keep single-use helper classes/functions inline
   inside the test function; extract to module level only when shared by 3+
   tests.
2. **Behavior-Sentence Naming & Single Behavior Per Test**:
   Test names must state the observable behavior (`test_<action>_when_<condition>`
   or `test_<subject>_<expected_outcome>`). Each test should verify one behavior
   following clear Arrange / Act / Assert separation.
3. **The Hollow-Proof Check & Transformation vs. Pass-Through Rule**:
   Before finalizing a test, ask: *"What production bug could pass this test?"*
   - If a hardcoded return value would pass, tighten the assertion.
   - Assert **transformed/computed outputs**, not echoed pass-through inputs
     (e.g. asserting `result.name == "foo"` when `name="foo"` was passed in only
     tests assignment, not business logic).
   - Never weaken or delete an existing assertion just to make a failing test
     pass.
4. **Provenance Docstrings on Regression Tests**:
   Every test added for a bug fix must include a concise provenance docstring so
   future contributors or agents do not delete or weaken it during refactoring:

   ```python
   def test_empty_identifier_raises_value_error() -> None:
       """Bug: whitespace-only identifiers bypassed length validation.
       Root cause: len() was checked before strip().
       Fix: normalize identifier via strip() prior to validation.
       """
   ```

5. **Zero-`sleep()` Concurrency Synchronization Policy**:
   Never use `time.sleep()`, `asyncio.sleep()`, or `anyio.sleep()` as a
   synchronization primitive in concurrent or async tests. Always coordinate
   producer/consumer or background task readiness with explicit primitives
   (`threading.Event`, `asyncio.Event`, `anyio.Event`). For async codebases,
   consider `blockbuster` to detect accidental blocking I/O calls inside the
   event loop, and `pytest-run-parallel` for PEP 703 free-threading stress
   testing.
6. **Fresh-Process Import-Graph Budget Testing**:
   To verify PEP 562 lazy imports (`_lazy.py`) or ensure top-level entry points
   do not eagerly import heavy optional dependencies (such as CLI frameworks),
   spawn a clean `subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-c", ...])` and assert that
   deferred modules are absent from `sys.modules`.
7. **Union & Registry Sync Tripwire Tests**:
   Whenever runtime registries, dispatch tables, or CLI option lists mirror a
   static `Literal` or `Union` type alias, add a reflection tripwire test using
   `typing.get_args()` (e.g. `assert set(REGISTRY) == set(get_args(ActionType))`)
   so adding a variant to the type without registering its runtime handler fails
   immediately in `pytest`.
